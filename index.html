    <h2>A little about me...</h2>
  
    <div>  
      <p>I am married and have two lovely children. Currently, this is my first year working as a
        STEM teacher. Previously, I taught as a Bilingual/Dual language Teacher for 14 years. I
        love learning about computers and technology. I am enjoying the process of learning how 
        to create my very own website. In the near future, I plan on creating a <b><i>Student 
        Friendly Website</i></b> for my STEM classes.</p>

    <h3>My hidden hobby that only few people know</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li><span class="background-color">Sketch drawing</span></li>
      <p>Sketch drawing used to be my favorite hobby but life change and I have not been able to do it in years. My son is now into this hobby. I should return to drawing one day when I have completed my studies and teach a few of my tricks to my son.</p>
      <li><span class="background-color">Painting</span></li><p>I used to love painting as well, especially in art class. I remember participating in art competition while I was in middle school and high school. I remember winning a few first place school wide art competitions. How I miss those days.</p>
